# Finger_Whack_A_Mole
A typing trainer which focuses on individual fingers; one at a time. Master all the keys assigned to one finger, move on to next.
(this is a toy project :)
# MVP: Just a tui showing keysets, finger, right or wrong press!
#Features to add:
- Whole keyboard is visible with next key highlighted,
- Punishments for wrong keypress
- Accuracy stats
- Practice weakest keys
- Keep other fingers on different positions while moving the practicing finger
- Practice concept:
    Random keys from keyset 15ish times.
    Wrong keypresses recorded with frequency. Sort and make it a stack
    Go to practice mistakes mode 
    Practice all possible combinations of the wrongly pressed key(top of stack) with other keys in the keyrange (for that finger). 
    Record mistakes, update frequency, re-sort the stack.
    When no mistakes made, go to the next finger

( If I abandon this project like a wus, I'll make this private )
